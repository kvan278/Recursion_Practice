# Recursion Practice Assignment

This project is designed to practice and enhance your understanding of recursion in programming. It includes the implementation of various recursive functions that solve common problems, demonstrating how recursion can simplify complex tasks.

## Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience with recursive algorithms.
- Understand how to break down problems into smaller, manageable subproblems.
- Explore the benefits and potential pitfalls of using recursion.

## Features
The project includes several recursive methods, including:
- **Binary Conversion**: Converts an integer to its binary representation.
- **String Reversal**: Reverses a given string using recursion.
- **Next Is Double**: Counts elements in an array that are followed by double their value.
- **Phone Mnemonics**: Generates letter combinations for a phone number.
- **Sierpinski Carpet**: Draws a fractal pattern using recursive graphics.
- **Water Flow Simulation**: Determines if water can flow off a terrain map.
- **Team Ability Balancing**: Computes the minimum ability difference between teams.

## Usage
To use this project, simply run the provided test cases to see the results of each recursive method in action.
